The next paragraph presents the description contained in this webpage.

Health expenditure occurs where money is spent on health goods and services.
It occurs at different levels of government, as well as by non-government entities such as private health insurers and individuals.
In many cases, funds pass through a number of different entities before they are ultimately spent by providers (such as hospitals, general practices and pharmacies) 
on health goods and services.
The term ‘health expenditure’ in this context relates to all funds given to, or for, providers of health goods and services. 
It includes the funds provided by the Australian Government to the state and territory governments, as well as the funds provided by the state and territory governments
to providers.

Our aim is to analyze the data to provide insights on health expenditure in Australia.
